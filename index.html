                <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
                <h2>Since I was little I have always had a deep interest in 
                    technology. As I grew older this interest never faded away 
                    which led me to pursue a career in technology. Although an introvert,
                    I've managed to push myself into the technology field in high school 
                    in order to gain experience within my desired field.
