            <h2>My love for technology has allowed me to find out my passions and what I want to do which is to pursue a career in Software Engineering.
                But technology isn't the only thing that I enjoy. Some of my hobbies are playing videogames like The Last of us and Spiderman. I also 
                like going out whether with family or friends. One thing I love is the piano. I am a piano fiend and have been since I was a child. 
                I've mastered many songs by composers such as Chopin and some by Beethoven. I am currently learning La Campanella and hope to play even harder songs
                once I've mastered this. Some other things I like to do is go to the gym and get a few sets in with my friend.</h2>
